  * Body:

    ```json
    {
      "followId": 1, // same as likeId (will have to visit DB SCHEMA for association) a user can follow many users (how do we create an association within a table?)
      "postId": 1,
      "userId": 2,
      "liked" : // a post method would add a "like" , a delete method would remove the "like"
      "createdAt": "2021-11-19 20:39:36",
      "updatedAt": "2021-11-19 20:39:36"
    }
    ```
* will we build the like table to have a likeId column that has true and false or 1 and 0 so if a post is liked that will assign a likeId which will connect a user and a like together?

  `post can only be liked or unliked so no error response for this feature`
